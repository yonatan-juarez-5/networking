Conference Room Reservation Systems are essential for efficiently
managing conference rooms in EE/CS buildings. They streamline room
bookings, simplify finding and reserving rooms, expedite the booking
process, and provide valuable information for decision-making. These
systems enable students to quickly locate available rooms for homework
discussions or midterm preparations.
Security is crucial for these systems. Ensuring system safety by requiring
usernames and passwords is vital. Only the client should access their
username and password to prevent unauthorized individuals from booking
rooms, ensuring availability for actual students. Building a secure, reliable,
and user-friendly online booking system is of utmost importance.

Specifically, messages containing personal information (e.g., username and
password) should be encrypted before being sent over the Internet.
For this project, you will develop a simple conference booking system for
two buildings, RTH and EEB, available to students. Students can check the
availability of conference rooms and make reservations for the following
week. They need to specify the room, day (e.g., Monday, Tuesday), and time
(e.g., 4 pm) to reserve a room.
Students can check room availability and book if it's free. They use a client
interface to connect with the main booking server (serverM), which
interfaces with backend servers for credential verification and room
information. The credential verification server (serverC) holds user
information (username/password pairs), while the room information servers
(serverRTH and serverEEB) store room details for their respective buildings.
The main server forwards requests to the appropriate server and relays
responses back to the client.
This conference room reservation system aims to provide a seamless and
efficient process for students seeking study spaces, ensuring a positive
experience from search to reservation.
